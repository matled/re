TODO comments in the script

interactive mode:
show what would be done and allow the user to apply, abort or edit

hide file extensions

multi directory stuff:
allow files to be moved to a new/between directory etc

config file
perhaps similar to the gem config file: just prepend the options specified in
the file to ARGV.  every option has to have a --no option then.
