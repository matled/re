rename edit
===========

Rename edit allows to use your favorite $EDITOR to change filenames.

.Example
----
% touch foo.txt bar.txt
% re -v *
$EDITOR starts with:
    # ./
    0 bar.txt
    1 foo.txt
Keep the numbers in front and change the filenames as you like:
    # ./
    0 file one.txt
    1 other file.txt
Write out the changes, the files are renamed accordingly:
"foo.txt" -> "other file.txt"
"bar.txt" -> "file one.txt"
